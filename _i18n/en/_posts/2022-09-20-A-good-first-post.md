## About ring theory

In algebra, ring theory is the study of ringsâ€”algebraic structures in which addition and multiplication are defined 
and have similar properties to those operations defined for the integers. Ring theory studies the structure of rings, 
their representations, or, in different language, modules, special classes of rings (group rings, division rings, 
universal enveloping algebras), as well as an array of properties that proved to be of interest both within the theory 
itself and for its applications, such as homological properties and polynomial identities.
