## Kittens
A kitten is a juvenile cat. After being born, kittens display primary altriciality and are totally 
dependent on their mothers for survival. They normally do not open their eyes for seven to ten days. 
After about two weeks, kittens develop quickly and begin to explore the world outside their nest. 
After a further three to four weeks, they begin to eat solid food and grow baby teeth. 
Domestic kittens are highly social animals and usually enjoy human companionship.
