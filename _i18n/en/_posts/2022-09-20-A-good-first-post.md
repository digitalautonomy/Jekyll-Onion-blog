## Online rights: learn, defend, disseminate

PrivaciQ is a day with open activities and outreach on the importance of privacy in the digital world, which aims to learn, defend and disseminate human and digital rights.

We will have initial workshops to help you to protect your data, as well as to navigate in a safe and anonymous way using free software tools. There will be talks with security experts, as well as panels addressing concerns about defending rights online.

We invite you to participate to talk about digital security, meet other people concerned about surveillance and also to get closer and learn more about the TOR project.

The meeting will take place this Saturday 18 March at the Faculty of Social and Human Sciences of the Central University of Ecuador (UCE) from 9:30 in the morning, entrance on Gaspar de Carvajal Street.
